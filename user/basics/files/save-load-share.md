# Save & Load & Share

## Save

Nodi stores node graphs in the cloud.

The node graph being edited is saved by selecting **Save** from the **File** menu in the header, and if it is a new file, a new unique URL is generated.

(ex. nodi3d.com/editor/a0b1c2d3e4f5g6 )

> Account information is required to save the file, so login required

## Load

You can check & load the saved node graph on the panel that displays the file list on the editor or on mypage ( /mypage/files ).

## Share

You can set access rights for each node graph.

Open the node graph for which you want to set access authority, and launch the setting screen from the **Share** button in the **File** menu on the editor.

If you set the privilege level to **private**, only **owner** and **collaborators** can see the corresponding node graph.

In addition, for collaborator, you can set the permission of **can view** or **can edit** or **admin**.

| Name | Permission | 
| ---- | ---- |
| can view | can view collaborators can only view the node graph. |
| can edit | can edit collaborators can edit the node graph. |
| admin | admin collaborators can edit node graphs, as well as add and remove other collaborators. admin has almost the same permissions as the owner. |

## Fork

You can **fork** a node graph without edit permission instead of overwriting.

Fork is to save another person's node graph as a separate file on your file list.

The forked node graph can be freely modified by you as the owner.

## Download

The node graph can be downloaded as a json file.
It is downloaded by selecting **Download** in the **File** menu.

The downloaded json file is read by Drag & Drop on the editor.

## Delete

in /mypage/files page, open the file menu by right click and select **Delete**.
